                    <h2>My Journey as Designer</h2>
            <p>
                      I'm a UI/UX Bootcamp Student at Georgia Tech, my specialty is not specializing in anything. I find myself attracted to so many different skills and industries I've find that I like to know a little bit about a lot of different things, which includes production, design, marketing, project management, video production, photography and many others. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Before even know that the profession of UI/UX was a thing I was already a big fan of improvements in user experience, always noticed little details in apps, websites, buttoms from all the applications that I used. Not only in the digital world, I also used to notice little things in every-day utilities as well.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      As student-designer I got involved with an amazing group of people that helped me develop great portfolio which you can see bellow. All the big projects had a depth research to understand better what the possible clients would like, from there the design was always focused on what the user wanted.
